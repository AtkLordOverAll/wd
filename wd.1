.SH SYNOPSIS
.B
wd [\fICOMMAND\fP] [\fINAME\fP]
.
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBwd\fP (warp directory) lets you quickly jump to custom directories in zsh, without using \fBcd\fP. Why? Because \fBcd\fP is slow for  paths that are visited frequently or has a long path.
.

Add a new warp point which will warp to the current working directory with \fI name\fR as identifier.

.IP "add! <name>"
Like \fBadd\fP but will overwrite existing point with the same \fIname\fP.
.
.IP "rm, -r, --remove <name>"
Add a new warp point with \fIname\fP as identifier.
.
.IP "ls, -l"
List all registered warp points.
.
.IP "show"
Show which warp points are registered to the current working directory.
.
.
